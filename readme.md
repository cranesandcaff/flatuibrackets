#Flat UI Theme for Brackets
 A Flat UI inspired theme for the Brackets editor,  it pulls heavily from the Toy Chest theme by Jackson Gariety and the Flat UI Sublime theme by acondiff. I tried to make as complete a theme as possible, there is no documentation for Codemirror so it involved a lot of trial and error.  Feel free to use or modify it, even if the color scheme isn't your style it might help to look through the comments if you plan on theming your own. I also made use of the Bear Theme for reference and I modified one of the default themes included in the extension but I can't remember which, but some comments came from that.
